# Dotbot

summary:
Dotbot creates a dotfile repository from the setup you have on your current/local machine

Add all the folder(s) (realpath) you want to include in the repository in the file named "folders.txt"
Add all the file(s) (realpath) you want to include in the repository in the file named "files.txt"

dotbot will then create a git repository (default: $HOME/project/dotfiles) with all your relevant files and folders
